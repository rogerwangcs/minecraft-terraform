# Minecraft Terraform

A winter 2023 pet project to learn terraform. In this exercise, we terraform the GCP resources needed to host and run a minecraft server with one click. Most of the heavy lifting is done by Chat GPT, but it's interesting terraform's power in provisioning cloud resources declaratively.

This terraform project explores terraform variables, resources, and providers. It provisions a GCE instance, a firewall rule, a static ip, and bash scripts to stand up a ready to go minecraft server.
